# Characteristics of distributions

## Distribution of common quantities

Many phenomena in nature have a relatively easily guessed distribution characteristics

-   What is the distribution of length of rivers in the U.S.?
-   What is the distribution of width of flower sepals?
-   What is the distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007?

Features to guess:

-   Shape
-   Center
-   Spread

```{webr}
#| label: pick1
sample(classroster$name, 1)
```

## Graphs of common quantities

### Length of rivers in the U.S.

```{webr}
#| label: riverlength
#| caption: "Graph of river lengths"
ggplot(data.frame(rivers), aes(x=rivers)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill="blue4", color="black") +
  labs(x="Length in miles", y="count")
```

### Flower sepal width

```{webr}
#| label: flowerwidth
#| caption: "Graph of flower sepal widths"
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill="blue4", color="black", bins=15) +
  labs(x="Sepal width", y="Count")
```

### Life expetancy in 2007

```{webr}
#| label: lifexpectancy
#| caption: "Graph of life expectancies"
gap2007 <-gapminder %>%
  filter(year==2007)

ggplot(gap2007, aes(x=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill="blue4", color="black") +
  labs(x="Life expectancy in years", y="Count")
```

## Height activity

What do you expect the shape, center, and spread of class height to be? Why? Write down with your partner your guesses.

```{webr}
#| label: pick2
sample(classroster$name, 1)
```

## Height distribution

```{webr}
#| label: heightdistribution
#| caption: "Distribution of heights in our class"

ggplot(heights, aes(x=heightincm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


## Closing thoughts

-   Many distributions can be guessed in advanced based on the data generating process
-   You should have at least a guess as to what the distribution is before starting your exploratory data analysis
-   Think carefully about what your variable is actually measuring
-   Characteristics of distributions are **summaries** of the data, almost always obscure features of the data
-   Don't mislead your readers!!
