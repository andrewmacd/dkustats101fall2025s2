Q1

-2 Histogram in 1b is strange
-2 Somehow you've gotten the wrong code to calculate home vs. away goals
-2 Your results in 1a and 1b don't exactly match your discussion in 1d. Need to think more clearly about what your results mean.
-1 1d could have a bit more thought put into it.
-1 I don't think a histogram with two layers is probably the best way to view this data
-1 In general, you should pick a plot type and focus on that plot rather than display a bunch of different plot types of the same thing
-1 In general, you should pick a plot type and focus on that plot rather than display a bunch of different plot types of the same thing


Q2 

-3 I think you are mis-interpreting your results. The home teams had more fouls than the away teams in non-Covid matches - this is a very surprising result! Additionally, I would say that the difference in covid matches is so small as to be effectively a zero result, I don't think you should interpret that difference as being meaningful.
-2 Need to relate the results in 2c to the hypothesis listed at the start of the question
-2 The home teams had more fouls than the away teams in Covid matches - this is a very surprising result! You should comment on this.


Q3

-1 Table should be formatted/labeled a bit better
-1 Explanations in 3d are ok but could be a little more thoughtful - it is a bit confusing.
-2 Need to interpret the magnitude of the z score - do they indicate a large difference from the group mean or a small one?

Q4

-2 I don't really understand your question or why it is meaningful
-2 4b conclusion needs to be more specific and thoughtful

Overall

-1 Document could be a little neater
-2 Document needs some cleanup
-2 Need to actually view/investigate outliers
-1 Graphs need better labeling
-1 Don't have your code showing unless specifically asked for
-10 Need to submit a rendered PDF file not a .qmd document
